# Contact / Address Book Application

## Description
I developed a Contact / Address Book Application to centralize my contact information in one accessible database. This application streamlines contact management by providing a unified platform for storing, viewing, editing, and deleting contacts. It eliminates the hassle of navigating through multiple sources such as email, phone contacts, and social media to find contact details.

## How to Run the Program
1. Save the code in a file with a ".py" extension.
2. Open a code editor like VS Code or PyCharm and create a new file.
3. Copy and paste the code into the file.
4. Save the file with a name, e.g., "contact_manager.py".
5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
6. Run the program by typing `python contact_manager.py` in the terminal and press Enter.
7. Enter "admin" for the username and "password" for the password in the login window.
8. Upon successful login, the contact management application window will appear.

*Alternatively, you can use Replit to see the output, unit tests, etc.

## How to Use and Interpret the Program
1. After logging in, you'll be in the contact management window.
2. Add new contacts by filling in the fields in the "Add Contact" section and clicking the "Add" button.
3. View all existing contacts by clicking the "View Contacts" button.
4. Edit a contact by clicking the "Edit Contact" button and providing the ID, First name, Last name, Email, and phone number.
5. Delete a contact by clicking the "Delete Contact" button and entering the contact's ID.
